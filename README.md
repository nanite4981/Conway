# Overview

- I wrote a small-scale version of Conway's Game of Life where we have a grid of cells that are either alive or dead, and they interact with each other in patterns.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wrote this software because I have a friend who's a big fan of Conway's game of life. I wanted to see what it was about.

# Development Environment

I developed my game using pygame in Visual Studio Code with Python.

# Useful Websites

- [Program Arcade Games](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=array_backed_grids&lang=en#section_16)

# Future Work

- I would like to incorporate controls to allow someone to build a pattern, then activate the game.
